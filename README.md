Compile accumulated exercises into a plan
- Edit an existing plan

Initial Design:
- Music
- Sorting and Categorizing
- Create video plans
- Catered to individual users  
   instead of user group

Evaluations:
-Wizard of Oz & Think Aloud
-Tested 2 initial designs with users
-Tested final design with experts

Results:
- “Much simpler than the current way to plan”
- “Love that I can take notes”
- Music feature not likely to be used
- Built in functionality confusion
- Names needed to be more explicit
- ⅖ Likert scale for cognitive workload
- ”Really easy to learn”
-Wanted sorting beyond tags

Final Design:
- Ability to tag and sort data with users input.
- Can plan using acquired content in a list form and video form. 
-Flexibility in planning styles

Remaining Issues:
-No hard statistics between old design and new one amongst user group
